# The_Odin_Project_Calculator
# On-Screen Calculator Project

Welcome to the On-Screen Calculator project! This project combines your knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a functional calculator that performs basic mathematical operations.

## Project Description

This calculator allows users to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes extra features such as handling decimals, clearing the input, and keyboard support.

## Project Setup

To run the calculator, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the calculator interface.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the calculator interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles calculator functionality.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Decimal support: Users can input floating-point numbers.
- Clear button: Resets the calculator to its initial state.
- Backspace button: Allows users to undo input.
- Keyboard support: Users can use keyboard keys for input and calculations.

## Usage

1. Click on digit buttons to input numbers.
2. Click on operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to select the operation.
3. Click on the decimal button to input floating-point numbers.
4. Press the "Clear" button to reset the calculator.
5. Press the "Backspace" button to undo input.
6. Press the "Enter" key to calculate the result.
7. The calculated result will be displayed on the screen.

## Implementation Details

- Basic math functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`) are implemented in JavaScript.
- The `operate` function combines the chosen operator and operands to perform calculations.
- The display is updated based on user input and calculated results.

## Challenges Faced

The most challenging part of this project was managing the order of operations and updating the display correctly after each step of the calculation.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some potential improvements that can be made to the calculator:

- Improved error handling for cases like division by zero.
- Scientific calculator mode with trigonometric and logarithmic functions.
- History feature to store and display past calculations.

## Credits

This project was completed as part of [Your Course Name] course by [Your Name].

## Conclusion

Creating this on-screen calculator was an excellent way to apply my JavaScript, HTML, and CSS skills. I learned how to manage user input, perform calculations, and update the interface dynamically. I'm excited to continue building more complex web applications in the future!
